	<h1>A DM's Guide to Dealing with PCs</h1>
	
	<h2>Day 1 - Kids These Days</h2>
	<p>
	Today I told these new kids I met who live on the other side of my floor about a role playing game called "Fate" and they seemed pretty interested. 
	They probably won't follow through with it though because no one ever is that seriously committed.
	In the mean time, half my other group is terrorizing a city, conning people while the lawful good half is off actually pursuing what I wanted them to follow.
	Friggin players man.
	</p>

	<h2>Day 3 - They Keep Coming</h2>
	<p>
	So they seem genuinely interested in what I'm sharing with them. 
	They keep bothering me at work, though they don't seem to have any ideas about what they want to do.
	My main group got sidetracked when they went to Brittany and ended up finding a subplot I totally didn't even mean to create but they seem to like it.
	</p>

	<h2>Day 7 - The Best Part of Any Campaign</h2>
	<p>
	Today we created character sheets. Those kids that have been bothering me sat down with me and we created a world (New York set in the year 3020) and a premise (Murder Mystery).
	I'm actually excited and most of them seem pretty serious about their characters. I'm sort of forcing them to be but they're newbs and I want them to learn how to roleplay properly.
	Meanwhile my main group hasn't met for a couple weekends and I'm going home so it's just getting really spread out.
	I need to actually finish that game.
